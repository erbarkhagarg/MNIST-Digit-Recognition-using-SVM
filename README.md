# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-using-SVM
 This is about recognizing the digit from an image (MNIST dataset) using SVM algorithm<br>
 The training dataset used is train.csv as uploaded in the repo<br>
 A part of the data set was used for training the model while a part of it was used to test the model.<br>
 Since the training data had a lot of records and considering the time SVM would take, only 20% of the data was used to train the model and the rest was kept aside to test the model on
